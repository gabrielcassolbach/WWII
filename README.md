Object Oriented Digital Game in C++

Abstract - Programing Techniques is a subject that requires the development of software in the shape of a
platform videogame with the objective of learning software engineering techniques, as well as object-oriented
programming in C++. To carry out this project, the game WWII++ was developed, where a player tries to
survive against many enemies and obstacles. For the development of the game the textually proposed
requirements were considered and modeling was elaborated (analysis and design) via Class Diagram in Unified
Modeling Language (UML) using a previously proposed generic diagram as a base. Posteriorly, the project was
developed using C++ programming language, contemplating usual Object Orientation concepts such as classes,
objects, relationships, as well as some advanced concepts, such as abstract classes, polymorphism, templates,
object persistence through files, operator overload, and the Standard Template Library (STL). After the
implementation, the game tests made by the developers demonstrated its functionality according to the
requirements and the modeling elaborated. At last, it stands out that the development in question was a valuable
source of learning and experience for the students.
